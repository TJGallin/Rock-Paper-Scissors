# Rock-Paper-Scissors
It's A Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

The game is rock paper scissors, where rock, paper, and scissors are denoted using LEDs on the right side of the board, and your opponent is denoted using mirrored LEDs on the left side of the board. This is traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors where paper covers rocks, rock crushes scissors, and scissors cut paper. You can choose between rock paper and scissors using the left and right buttons on the board to switch the states, and once a selection has been made, the user will touch the nail/touch sensor (Pin A1)to signify that they are ready. The randomizing program will begin, and depending upon the outcome, the person will win, lose, or draw, with an accompanied sound and voice memo for each.
